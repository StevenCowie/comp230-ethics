# comp230-ethics
## Ideas

Video games leading to bad behaviour and desensitizing children to the real world

How people with different ethics can affect how a game is made

Should all games have a set standard of morals all developers should follow

Stereotyping in games especially females

## Question
What are the effects hypersexualisation of female characters has on the games industry and what can be done to avoid this issue?

With the games industry being worth $90 billion a year and constantly expanding out to a larger audience everyday, it is very important to make sure that females are given appropriate roles to play in games as well as making sure they are not hypersexualised as seen in many games today.  People often stereotype gamers to be young boys but a study showed the average age of gamers in the US is 35 years old. Female gamers are stereotyped the most but with several studies being done over the past few years showing the number of women gamers increasing, should game developers be forced to change the way they stereotype women in video games and change the way games are made by adding in playable female characters and be forced to portray them differently. With everyone having different ethics it is hard to come up with a standard that suits everyone. However at the other end of the spectrum is it wrong to limit their creativity?

# comp230-ethics
## Ideas

Video games leading to bad behaviour and desensitizing children to the real world

How people with different ethics can affect how a game is made

Should all games have a set standard of morals all developers should follow

Stereotyping in games especially females

## Question
What are the negative effects on females with the misrepresentation of females the way they are portrayed in the games industry.

With the games industry being worth $90 billion a year and constantly expanding out to a larger audience everyday, how important is it to make games female friendly and ensure females aren't portrayed too hypersexual. People often stereotype gamers to be young boys but a study showed the average age of gamers in the US is 35 years old. Female gamers are stereotyped the most but with several studies being done over the past few years showing the number of women gamers increasing, should game developers be forced to change the way they stereotype women in video games and change the way games are made by adding in playable female characters. Do the negative views from the typical male gamer effect the amount of female workers in industry as they only make up 14% in the UK. With everyone having different ethics it is hard to come up with a standard that suits everyone. However at the other end of the spectrum is it wrong to limit their creativity but at what cost does it have to females.
